# Elmo

**Optimize your brand's perception in LLMs and _drive sales_.**

Elmo is a web app that helps you track how different LLMs and AI Search perceive your brand. You may have heard this referred to as AIO, AEO, GEO, ASO, or LLMO (Elmo).

## Quick Start
```
pnpm install
turbo start
```

We will be updating this README with detailed instructions (as well as a Docker install option) in the near future.

## License

[Blue Whale Software, LLC](https://bluewhale.dev) operates Elmo as commercial open source, which means some parts of this open source repository require a commercial license. The concept is called "Open Core" where the core technology (99%) is fully open source, licensed under [AGPLv3](https://opensource.org/license/agpl-v3) and the last 1% is covered under a [commercial license](https://github.com/elmohq/elmo/tree/main/packages/cloud/LICENSE) which we believe is entirely relevant for larger organisations that require enterprise features. Enterprise features are built by the core  team of Blue Whale Software, LLC.

> [!NOTE]  
> Our philosophy is simple, all "singleplayer" functionality is open-source under AGPLv3. All commercial "multiplayer" functionality is under a commercial license.
